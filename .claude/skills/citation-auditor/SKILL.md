Audit the markdown or DOCX file described by `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into optional flags and one file path.
   - Recognized local-only flags: `--local-only`, `--no-web`, `--offline`.
   - If any recognized local-only flag is present, set `local_only` to `true`; otherwise set `local_only` to `false`.
   - Recognized output flag: `--overwrite`. If present, pass `--overwrite` to `prepare`; otherwise do not overwrite existing sidecar outputs.
   - Do not infer `local_only` from natural-language sensitivity words alone. If the user mentions a sensitive, private, privileged, confidential, PHI, PII, 민감, 비밀, or 특권 document but did not pass one of the recognized flags, pause before auditing and ask whether to rerun with `--local-only`.
   - If an unknown flag is present, stop and ask for a valid flag or a plain file path.
   - If there is not exactly one file path after removing recognized flags, ask for one markdown or DOCX file path.
2. Run `python -m citation_auditor prepare "<file-path>"` plus `--overwrite` if the user supplied that flag. Parse stdout as JSON.
   - If `prepare` fails because an output file already exists, stop and tell the user to rerun with `--overwrite` only if they intentionally want to replace the existing sidecar report.
   - Use `mode`, `audit_input`, and `paths` from the prepare JSON. Do not invent temporary paths or sidecar output paths yourself.
   - Write the exact prepare JSON stdout to `paths.prepare_manifest_json` before continuing.
   - If `mode` is `docx_report`, run:
     `python -m citation_auditor extract-docx "<source_path>" --out-md "<paths.audit_source_md>" --out-map "<paths.source_map_json>"`
     The original DOCX must remain untouched.
3. Run `python -m citation_auditor chunk "<audit_input>" --max-tokens 3000`, where `audit_input` comes from the prepare JSON.
4. Parse stdout as JSON with the schema `{ "chunks": [...] }`.
5. For each chunk, extract verifiable factual claims and citation-bearing claims using structured output with this schema:
   - `text: string`
   - `sentence_span: { start: integer, end: integer }`
   - `claim_type: factual | citation | quantitative | temporal | other`
   - `suggested_verifier: string | null`
   - `audit_reason: factual | citation | quantitative | temporal | null`
   Include concrete factual assertions even when no citation is attached, especially:
   - dates and effective dates
   - numeric claims
   - named legal authority or institutional action
   - existence or non-existence of a statute, case, agency act, paper, organization, or person
6. Do not extract speculation, forecasts, rumors, advocacy, or soft prediction language such as:
   - `전망이다`
   - `예상된다`
   - `업계 관계자에 따르면`
   - `가능성이 있다`
   Unless the sentence also contains a concrete verifiable factual assertion that stands on its own.
7. Keep claim offsets chunk-relative. Do not convert them to document offsets yourself.
8. Route each claim to verifier skills:
   - If `suggested_verifier` is set and exactly matches a loaded verifier skill name, use it.
   - Otherwise test the claim text against each verifier skill frontmatter `metadata.patterns` using case-insensitive regex matching and use every match.
   - For backward compatibility with older third-party verifier skills, if `metadata.patterns` is absent, fall back to top-level frontmatter `patterns`.
   - If nothing matches, fall back to `general-web`.
9. For each `(claim, verifier)` pair, use the Task tool to dispatch a subagent that loads that verifier skill and receives `{ "claim": <claim JSON>, "local_only": <local_only> }`. DOCX mode uses the same verifier payload rule as markdown mode.
10. Require each verifier subagent to return only this JSON:
   `{ "label": "...", "rationale": "...", "supporting_urls": ["..."], "authority": 0.0 }`
11. `supporting_urls` may contain either clickable source URLs or plain-language source references when no stable URL exists. Preserve them verbatim and do not invent clickable URLs for non-linkable sources such as precedent search-result IDs.
12. Build aggregate input JSON locally. The exact top-level shape is `{ "verdicts": [ <bundle>, ... ] }` where each `<bundle>` covers one `(chunk, claim)` pair and holds all verifier candidates for that claim. Do not invent other top-level keys.

    **Exact schema (copy this structure):**
    ```json
    {
      "verdicts": [
        {
          "chunk": { "index": 0, "text": "<full chunk text>", "segments": [ { "chunk_start": 0, "chunk_end": 44, "document_start": 0, "document_end": 44 } ] },
          "claim": { "text": "<claim sentence>", "sentence_span": { "start": 64, "end": 268 }, "claim_type": "citation", "suggested_verifier": "us-law", "audit_reason": "citation" },
          "candidates": [
            {
              "claim": { "text": "<same claim as above>", "sentence_span": { "start": 64, "end": 268 }, "claim_type": "citation", "suggested_verifier": "us-law", "audit_reason": "citation" },
              "verifier_name": "us-law",
              "authority": 0.9,
              "label": "contradicted",
              "rationale": "<Korean rationale from verifier>",
              "evidence": [ { "url": "https://..." } ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Rules:
    - One bundle per `(chunk, claim)` pair. If the same claim has two verifiers, put both candidates inside the same bundle's `candidates` array — do NOT create a second bundle for the same claim.
    - The top-level `claim` inside each bundle is the canonical claim; each candidate's `claim` must match it verbatim.
    - `audit_reason` is optional for backward compatibility, but include it whenever claim extraction produced it.
    - `evidence` items require a non-empty `url` string. If the verifier returned `supporting_urls: []`, emit `"evidence": []` — do not emit `[{"url": ""}]`.
    - `label` must be one of `verified` / `contradicted` / `unknown`.
    - `authority` must match the verifier skill's declared `metadata.authority` value. For older third-party verifier skills, top-level frontmatter `authority` is an accepted fallback.

13. Write that JSON to `paths.aggregate_input_json` from the prepare JSON and run:
    `python -m citation_auditor aggregate "<paths.aggregate_input_json>"`
14. Write the aggregate stdout to `paths.aggregate_output_json` from the prepare JSON, then run:
    `python -m citation_auditor finalize "<paths.prepare_manifest_json>" "<paths.aggregate_output_json>"`
15. Return:
    - In markdown mode, only the `finalize` stdout annotated markdown unless the user explicitly asked for intermediate JSON.
    - In DOCX report mode, parse the `finalize` stdout JSON and return only the generated `.audit.md` and `.audit.json` paths plus a concise Summary table from the JSON `summary`. Do not paste the full report into chat unless the user explicitly asks for it.
16. If claim extraction validation fails, retry once with a repair prompt. If it still fails, skip that chunk and note it briefly.
17. If a verifier subagent returns invalid JSON, drop that candidate instead of inventing a verdict.
18. If a line was skipped because it is a forecast, opinion, rumor, or unattributed speculation, treat that as expected behavior rather than an extraction failure.
19. If the user asks why a forecast or opinion line was not audited, explain that this plugin audits verifiable factual claims and citations, not predictions or commentary.
