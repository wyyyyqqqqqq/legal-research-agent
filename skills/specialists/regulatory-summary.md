# Regulatory Document Summarization

Produces a structured summary of regulatory documents grounded in pinpoint citations, serving as both a standalone reference and a compliance roadmap.

## Quick Start

1. Collect the regulatory document(s) — final/proposed rules, guidance, enforcement actions, no-action letters, compliance frameworks, or administrative decisions
2. Note any available context: client industry, compliance posture, specific questions
3. Generate summary following the output structure below

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview (2–3 sentences)

- Issuing authority, document type, core purpose
- Most significant takeaway
- Effective date or comment deadline

### 2. Document Metadata

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Issuing Agency | |
| Document Type | Final rule / Proposed rule / Guidance / Enforcement / Other |
| Citation / Docket No. | |
| Effective Date | |
| Comment Deadline | (if applicable) |
| Compliance Deadline(s) | |
| Regulated Entities | |
| Supersedes / Amends | |

### 3. Key Provisions

| # | Provision | Requirement / Prohibition | Citation (§, ¶, p.) | Compliance Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | |

- Quote operative definitions and critical language verbatim
- Flag ambiguity or discretionary interpretation with `[AMBIGUOUS]`

### 4. Changes from Prior Framework

| Area | Prior Rule | New Rule | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|

Omit if document does not amend a prior framework.

### 5. Safe Harbors & Exemptions

- Each safe harbor, exemption, or de minimis threshold with citation
- Qualifying conditions

### 6. Enforcement & Penalties

| Violation Type | Penalty Range | Enforcement Mechanism | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|

### 7. Cross-References

- **[Citation]** — relevance to this document

### 8. Compliance Action Items

| Priority | Action | Deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Immediate | | | |
| Near-term | | | |
| Ongoing | | | |

### 9. Open Questions & Ambiguities

- Unclear or interpretation-dependent regulatory text
- Expected future guidance or rulemaking
- Issues requiring specialist follow-up

## Guardrails

- **Source-grounded**: Never infer requirements absent from the document
- **Pinpoint citations**: Section, paragraph, or page for every substantive claim
- **Verbatim quoting**: Definitions, operative requirements, deadlines
- **Plain language**: Pair with technical regulatory terminology
- **`[AMBIGUOUS]` flag**: Mark interpretive uncertainty — do not guess agency intent
- **Scale appropriately**: ~1 page for simple guidance, up to ~3 pages for complex final rules
- **Procedural posture**: Note NPRM, interim final rule, or final rule when part of broader rulemaking
- **Analytical neutrality**: Do not editorialize on policy merits
