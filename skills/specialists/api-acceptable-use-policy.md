# API Acceptable Use Policy

## Runtime Rule

Use this file as the compact API AUP drafting checklist. Load
`references/packs/api-acceptable-use-policy.md` only when drafting or revising an
API Acceptable Use Policy.

## Purpose

Draft a standalone AUP that is incorporated by reference into a master agreement.
Keep fast-changing behavioral and security rules in the AUP while stable commercial
and contractual rights stay in the master agreement.

## Execution Checklist

Read `references/packs/api-acceptable-use-policy.md` and apply its detailed intake,
allocation, matrix, template, post-draft, and pitfalls rules.

1. Run pre-draft intake unless the user says `use defaults` or `just draft`.
2. Apply defaults and label them when the user omits details.
3. Map AUP vs. master agreement scope using the allocation table.
4. Build a prohibited-use matrix with severity and enforcement treatment.
5. Include developer security requirements.
6. Define graduated enforcement with immediate suspension for severe violations.
7. Define versioning and notice mechanics.
8. Generate a publication-ready AUP template with all `[BRACKETED]` placeholders.
9. Run post-draft alignment questions.
10. Include the required disclaimer in every output.
