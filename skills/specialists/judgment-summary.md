# Judgment Summary

Citation-ready summary of a final judgment or opinion — holdings, standards of review, precedent treatment, and practical impact.

Use this file as the compact workflow. Load
`references/packs/judgment-summary.md` when drafting, tailoring, or
quality-checking a judgment summary, or when standards of review, issue/holding
tables, precedent treatment, disposition, remand instructions, costs/fees,
deadlines, or practical implications are needed.

## Prerequisites

1. Full opinion or judgment text with page/paragraph numbering.
2. Case citation details: court, docket number, decision date, judge/panel.
3. Procedural posture and any relevant lower court rulings.

## Quick Start

1. Extract case metadata; confirm jurisdiction.
2. Identify issues, standards of review, and holdings with pinpoint cites.
3. Separate background, material, and disputed facts.
4. Track precedent treatment and circuit-split implications.
5. Capture disposition, remand instructions, and deadlines.
6. Translate holdings into practical implications — no advocacy.

Fill every section below. If a field is missing, write `Not stated`.

## Pitfalls

- **Holdings vs. dicta**: Distinguish explicitly; never elevate dicta to holding status.
- **Neutral tone**: No advocacy or editorial framing.
- **Court terminology**: Preserve the court's exact language for standards and tests.
- **Uncertain citations**: Mark with `[Unverified]`.
- **No inference**: Do not infer facts or procedural steps absent from the opinion.
- **Non-U.S. courts**: Note deviations from U.S. practice in the Synopsis.
- **Pinpoint cites required**: Every holding and every court-labeled material fact needs one.

## Reference Pack

- `references/packs/judgment-summary.md` - judgment metadata, procedural
  history, standards of review, issue/holding table, precedent treatment,
  disposition/remand rules, costs/fees/deadlines, key citations, checklist, and
  pitfalls.
