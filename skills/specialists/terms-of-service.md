# Terms of Service Agreement

Drafts an enforceable TOS tailored to the service model, data flows, and jurisdictional compliance needs.

## Runtime Rule

Use this file as the compact drafting checklist. Load `references/packs/terms-of-service.md` when drafting, tailoring, or QC'ing a Terms of Service agreement, or when clause-selection tables, sample clauses, privacy hooks, or pitfalls are needed.

## Intake Checklist

Gather before drafting:

- Company legal name, address, and contact email.
- Service name plus URL/app identifiers.
- Eligibility and age minimum.
- Countries/states served.
- Payment model, renewals, cancellation, and refund approach if paid.
- IP assets, trademarks, and content ownership assumptions.
- UGC and moderation approach if users can submit content.
- APIs, integrations, or third-party services if any.

Ask before drafting if the contracting entity, service identity, eligibility, served jurisdictions, or payment/UGC facts are unclear.

## Drafting Checklist

1. Load the reference pack before drafting clauses or reviewing a TOS.
2. Select clauses based on service model: acceptance, accounts, acceptable use, UGC/IP, payments, third-party services, termination, disclaimers, liability, indemnity, dispute resolution, and boilerplate.
3. Prefer clickwrap or explicit assent mechanics; do not rely on browsewrap alone.
4. Tailor privacy/data hooks to actual data flows and incorporated privacy policy terms.
5. Add UGC license, moderation, and DMCA/takedown mechanics only when UGC exists.
6. Add paid-service terms only when payment facts are known; cover auto-renewal, cancellation, refunds, taxes, and fees.
7. Select dispute-resolution mechanics and consumer carve-outs based on audience and jurisdictions.
8. Use jurisdiction-specific claims carefully; mark uncertain legal statements `[Unverified]`.
9. Run the final QC checklist from the reference pack before delivering.

## Output Sections

Draft in this order unless the user provides a different template:

1. Definitions, acceptance, versioning, and effective date.
2. Eligibility and authority.
3. Account registration, security, and accuracy.
4. Acceptable use and prohibited conduct.
5. UGC, IP ownership, feedback, and third-party services.
6. Payment terms if applicable.
7. Termination, suspension, and survival.
8. Disclaimers, warranty exclusions, liability limits, and indemnity if applicable.
9. Governing law, venue/arbitration, and consumer carve-outs.
10. Notices, assignment, severability, and miscellaneous boilerplate.

## Blocking Rules

- Do not promise security, uptime, compliance, deletion, or support practices beyond actual controls.
- Do not overstate waiver enforceability for consumers, EU/UK users, or California residents.
- Do not include a liability cap, arbitration clause, or class waiver without preserving mandatory non-waivable rights where applicable.
- Do not omit incorporated policy links, effective date, update method, notice method, or survival terms.
